# WeatherApp

I first started using asynchronous JS on this project in order to fetch data from a weather API (accuWeather). I created two scripts files: one where I defined classes with asynchronous JS to get the weather forecast and another for the application of the script. In the forecast.js file I first defined the class constructor which creates an environment for the future functions (updateCity(), getCity() and getWeather()). In the app.js file I put a constant in an arrow function to get the city name and the weather forecast. For design purposes, I added the day/night time icon depending on the current hour in that specific city.
